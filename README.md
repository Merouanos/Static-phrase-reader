# Static-sentence-reader
This c programme reads a sentence of 50 words max that contains only alphapetic characters and doesn't start or end with a blank.
It will print the non repeated word in the sentence ,sort them and then print the longest word in the sentence.
It's a simple programme not that much challenging it only requires some basic knowledge in string functions in c to understand.
